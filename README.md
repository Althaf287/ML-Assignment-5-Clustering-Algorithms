# ML-Assignment-5-Clustering-Algorithms

**Overview In this project,**

I apply two clustering algorithms (KMeans and Hierarchical Clustering) to the Iris dataset, using Python and libraries like sklearn and scipy. The goal is to explore how these algorithms group data based on flower attributes.

## Steps
### **Data Loading & Preprocessing:**

- The Iris dataset is loaded, and the features are standardized using StandardScaler.

### **KMeans Clustering:**

- I use KMeans to group the dataset into 3 clusters. The results are visualized using a scatter plot.

### **Hierarchical Clustering:**

- I apply hierarchical clustering and visualize the results using a dendrogram.

## **Results**
- The clustering results will be shown as a scatter plot for KMeans and a dendrogram for Hierarchical Clustering.
